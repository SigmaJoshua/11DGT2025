            <h1>What Is Worship?</h1>
            <p>Explanation</p>
            <p>Worship is the act of expressing love, reverence, and devotion to God. It is more than just singing songs or attending church—it is a lifestyle that reflects a heart surrendered to God. Worship can be both personal and communal, taking place in private prayer, Bible study, or moments of gratitude, as well as in gatherings of believers through music, preaching, and acts of service.</p>
            <p>At its core, worship is about acknowledging who God is and what He has done. It is a response to His goodness, grace, and power. In John 4:24, Jesus says, "God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth." This means that true worship is not just about outward actions but comes from a sincere heart aligned with God's truth.</p>
